Being a complete newbie at Javascript, I would say my first experiences with the language were good. I felt it had similar shorthand notations like Python, while being similar to Java in other aspects. I thought Javascript was about the same difficulty as Java, and that it seems like a good programming language from a software engineering perspective. However, since we've had very little exposure to the language overall, I feel like it is a bit early for me to make any assumptions regarding the language for software engineering.

As for athletic software engineering, I'm still not too sure how I feel about it. The practice WODs were helpful to refresh on programming concepts and it was nice to be able to practice over and over again. As for the style of learning, I feel it is punishing for those who aren't fast learners, since you are graded based on time. Also the time constraints artifically increase the difficulty and stress of the problems that we are solving. At this point, I feel like I will be able to adapt to this style of learning and enjoy it as the semester progresses.
