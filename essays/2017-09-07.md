Asking questions are important when learning something for the first time. In the age of the internet, information on almost any topic can be accessed within seconds. However, with access to forums such as Reddit and Stack Overflow, it can be easy to be lazy and just ask for help without doing prior research. As a frequent user of Reddit, it can be a common occurence where people will post questions without searching first or using a pinned megathread. Doing such things usually annoys frequent users of the subreddit, and repeat offenses usually results in bans. 
By doing prior research before asking a question on a public forum, you are able to ask for specific information rather than a broad answer.
