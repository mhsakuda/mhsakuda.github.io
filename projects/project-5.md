<img class="ui fluid image" src="../images/digits.png">

Digits was an application developed in ICS 314 using the Meteor Javascript framework. It was our first introduction into using the software to create and launch an application through a browser. 

This application had multiple steps in which we first built the baseline application and added a basic function to add to the database, and then modified it to add additional functions, such as editing and deleting current entries in the database. We also implement a login function to only allow those who logged in to edit the database.

Overall, this project allowed us to familiarize ourself with building and developing applications using the Meteor framework, understand how MongoDB works, and how to correctly build and deploy applications using Meteor.
