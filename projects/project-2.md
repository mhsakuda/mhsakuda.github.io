Grocery List was an program that I developed for ICS 211, Spring 2014. This assignment helped me understand how to use arrays to store user inputted data, and how to edit arrays in Java.

Using Java, I was able to program a user-driven menu which displayed add, remove, list, edit, and quit functions. Command-line arguments allow the user to edit an exisiting list, and the program will write the new list to an output file when the user is finished.

In this assignment I strengthened my understanding of arrays in Java, and had a first hand experience of the uses of arrays in developing programs. I also was able to use previous knowledge from past assignments, such as using command-line arguments, and developing a user-driven menu interface.
